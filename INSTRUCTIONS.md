# Senior Backend Engineer Challenge (2-5 hrs)

Thanks for trying our development challenge!

With this document you should have received one other file, an executable binary called `loggerator`.

If you haven't received any of this file, or if you think there are any problems with the file, please contact us immediately and we will address any issues.

Let's get started.

**IMPORTANT, KNOWN ISSUES**: If you are using MacOS Catalina, you may run into a blocking warning _"... cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"_. In order to address this, navigate to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General and enable the app by clicking "Allow Anyway". For more information see [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23033#issuecomment-540417305). If you are having trouble passing this step, please feel free to contact us!

#### The Logs

The logs we ask you to consume in this challenge are sent from `loggerator` and are HTTP access logs.

For reference, check out this link https://www.w3.org/Daemon/User/Config/Logging.html.

Here is an example of what output may look like:

```
#### The Configuration

During development, it is possible (and likely a good idea) to change the behavior of the `loggerator`. You can do this by using flags:

`$ ./loggerator --help`.

1. **count** - Default: 800000, the amount of logs to be sent over the connection
2. **port** - Default: 8080, the port used by TCP server to send HTTPD logs
3. **seed** - Default: 1, the seed used to coerce log output deterministically

For example, `$ ./loggerator --count 15 --port 8080 --seed 3`

#### The Challenge

We ask that you write a program (or programs) capable of the following:

- must connect to `loggerator`; receive logs sent over the connection
- must have HTTP REST endpoint called `/logs` that allows a user to search logs sent over from `loggerator`; this endpoint must support the following query parameters and return a filtered subset of logs received
	- `code`, e.g. (`code=503`)
	- `method`, e.g. (`method=GET`)
	- `user`, e.g. (`user=randybishop`)
- must return logs in descending order by date, when any permutation of `/logs` is requested 

For example, assume the logs your program receive are the ones above (from the section **The Logs**). Let's imagine a user chooses to `curl` your program.

`$ curl <YOUR_SERVER>/logs?user=annstewart&method=POST`


```json
[
	"23.59.50.157 - annstewart [18/Jul/2000 02:12:31 +0000] \"POST /photos/90 HTTP/1.0\" 500 97"
	"23.59.50.157 - annstewart [08/Jul/2000 08:08:53 +0000] \"POST /bookmarks/123 HTTP/1.0\" 200 562",
]
```

**NOTE** Please treat this as an opportunity to show off and let see how you would write something that you'd be proud of! There is no one "correct" answer.

#### Your Solution

We are expecting that you send us the source code of a fully implemented solution for the proposed challenge **using the default configurations** of `loggerator`. Furthermore, your code should build and run on a Mac or GNU/Linux machine running a recent OS.

Third party libraries are permitted; however, as our intent is to come to understand your design choices, we ask for a short description of your rationale of your choices.

#### Before submitting your code

**IMPORTANT**: To help keep code reviews anonymous, please be sure to remove any sensitive information about yourself from your deliverable.

**We expect you to make sure that your solution works with `loggerator` before sending it to us**. In order to test that your implementation works, be sure you have the server you've written running and listening to port 8080, then run:

```
$ ./loggerator --count 10
```
This will start the process and begin listening for connections on which to send logs. Once all logs have been sent, the connection will be closed.

```bash
2020/02/05 11:09:44 listening on port 8080
2020/02/05 11:09:56 74716754 bytes written to &{{0xc0001d6080}}
```

### Acceptance Criteria

We expect you to write **code you would consider production-ready**. This can mean a variety of things, but most importantly we look for code to be well-factored, follow good practices and be tested.

What we will look for:

- Does your code fulfil the requirement and successfully run against the `loggerator`?
- How quickly does the `/logs` endpoint return queries? Are they correct?
- How clean is your design? How easy is it to understand, maintain or extend your code?
- How did you verify your software, if by automated tests or by other means?
- What kind of documentation did you ship with your code?

Good luck!
